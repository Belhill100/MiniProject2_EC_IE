## Project Description
This project is a text-based adventure game inspired by the classic **Zork**. The game leverages the **OpenAL** library to create a fully immersive audio experience, where the player can navigate through a story that is enriched with spatialized sounds. The sounds are dynamically positioned according to the player's perspective, creating a realistic 3D audio environment. For example, when the story describes a river to the right, the sound will be positioned to the right speaker, providing an immersive experience.

The game includes at least 50 lines of text to ensure a complete storyline with a beginning, middle, and end, playable for a minimum of five minutes.

## Why We Did It This Way
The primary objective of this project was to enhance player immersion through a rich auditory experience synchronized with the narrative. We chose to use the **OpenAL** library because of its robust capabilities for creating 3D spatial audio. The text-based interface was selected to focus primarily on audio-driven storytelling, without the complexity of graphical elements.

Our approach includes:
- Pairing each line of the story with an appropriate sound effect or music piece.
- Spatial positioning of audio elements based on their narrative context.
- Clean, modular code structure following best practices, making the game easy to expand and maintain.

## Technical Implementation
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Library**: OpenAL 
- **Audio Design**: Sounds are spatially positioned to create a diegetic 3D audio environment, enhancing player immersion.
- **Code Structure**: Organized into modules for story progression, sound management, and user input handling, ensuring clarity and ease of maintenance.

## Requirements
- The game must utilize the OpenAL library.
- At least 50 lines of text to form a coherent story.
- A command-line interface for navigating the story.

## Justification
Our design choices, such as using OpenAL for spatial audio and maintaining a text-based format, were driven by the desire to focus on the auditory aspects of the game. The modular code structure and adherence to Clean Code principles ensure that the game remains easy to read, maintain, and expand.
